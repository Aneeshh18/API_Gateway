## Welcome to API_GATEWAY

FRONTEND - MIDDLE-END - BACKEND

We need an intermediate layer between the client side and the microservices
Using this middle end, when the client sends a request we will be able to make a decision that which microservice should actually respond to this request
We can do message validation, response transformation, rate limiting
We try to prepare an API Gateway that acts as this middle end.
